Use Case:

Implement an end2end HealthClub Membership Management system for your favorite Health club/Gym, 

The emphasis here is on team collaboration, so the points awarded will be based on individual contributions to the team and how the team performed overall.  

    Components
        APIs - input and output of API should be in JSON and should include error handling and validation of inputs
        APIs will be demonstrated using a Web/mobile UI
        UI is accessed by Members, Non-Members, and HealthClub employees (who are admins) -  (3 roles)
        APIs should support following functionality:
            View Home page showing information about the Gym and memberships available and Class schedules - viewable by all users
            Enrolled and logged in Members:
                View members page - showing your individual class schedule,
                View Activities in the past week/month/last 90 days
                Signup for classes in advance
                Log hours on Treadmill, Cycling, Stair machines or weight training
            Healthclub employees :
                Enroll new members
                Checkin members into the Gym each time they enter
                Checkout members each time they exit the Gym
                Signup non-members for free trials
                View analytics dashboard showing User activity summarized by location
                    Classes and enrollment by day/week
                    Hours spent in the gym by day/week/month
                    Number of visitors by the hour each day, weekday, weekend
                    Any other useful dashboard (your team can get creative!) that will help planning gym hours, schedules, equipment inventory
            APIs and UI functionality will be available based on Roles specified above
            Assume the gym membership will be valid in multiple locations and Home page will let you select the Location to view corresponding schedules
